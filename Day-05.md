# üìò Day 5 - IBM MQ Practice

## App-user security & MCAUSER ==> Implementing Channel Authentication and User Authorization
## üéØ Objective
Enhance the security of your IBM MQ environment by configuring channel authentication (CHLAUTH) rules and setting appropriate user authorizations.

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites
IBM MQ 9.4.0.10 installed on CentOS

User with mqm group privileges

Environment variables configured using setmqenv

Queue manager QM1 created and running

## ‚úÖ Steps
## 1. Create a Non-Privileged User
Create a new user appuser to be used for channel connections:

```bash
sudo useradd appuser
sudo passwd appuser
```
Ensure appuser is not part of the mqm group to maintain least privilege.

## 2. Create a Server-Connection Channel
Define a new server-connection channel APP.SVRCONN:

```bash
runmqsc QM1
DEFINE CHANNEL('APP.SVRCONN') CHLTYPE(SVRCONN) TRPTYPE(TCP)
END
```
## 3. Configure Channel Authentication (CHLAUTH) Rules
Map connections from a specific IP address to the appuser user ID:

```bash
runmqsc QM1
SET CHLAUTH('APP.SVRCONN') TYPE(ADDRESSMAP) ADDRESS('192.168.1.100') MCAUSER('appuser')
END
```
This rule ensures that any connection to APP.SVRCONN from IP 192.168.1.100 will run under the appuser identity.

## 4. Set User Authorizations
Grant appuser the necessary permissions:

```bash
runmqsc QM1
SET AUTHREC OBJTYPE(QMGR) PRINCIPAL('appuser') AUTHADD(CONNECT, INQ)
SET AUTHREC PROFILE('APP.QUEUE') OBJTYPE(QUEUE) PRINCIPAL('appuser') AUTHADD(PUT, GET)
END
```
Ensure that APP.QUEUE exists or create it:

```bash
runmqsc QM1
DEFINE QLOCAL('APP.QUEUE')
END
```
## 5. Test the Configuration
Attempt to connect to QM1 using the APP.SVRCONN channel from IP 192.168.1.100 and perform put/get operations on APP.QUEUE.

Use the amqsputc and amqsgetc utilities for testing:

```bash
amqsputc APP.QUEUE QM1
amqsgetc APP.QUEUE QM1
```
Ensure that the operations succeed, confirming that the channel authentication and user authorizations are correctly configured.

## üìò Explanation
CHLAUTH Rules: Channel authentication records (CHLAUTH) provide a mechanism to control access to channels based on various criteria such as IP address, user ID, and SSL/TLS credentials. 
IBM

MCAUSER: The MCAUSER attribute specifies the user ID under which the channel runs. Mapping connections to a specific MCAUSER ensures that the channel operates with the intended permissions.

Authorization Records: AUTHREC commands are used to grant or revoke permissions for users on various MQ objects like queues and the queue manager itself.
